	<p>But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not. don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!

		I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow! Leia! Go! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.

		Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!

		Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord.

		Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.
